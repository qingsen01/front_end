Description: Goku’s adventure from the best-selling classic manga Dragon Ball continues in this new series written by Akira Toriyama himself!

Ever since Goku became Earth’s greatest hero and gathered the seven Dragon Balls to defeat the evil Boo, his life on Earth has grown a little dull. But new threats loom overhead, and Goku and his friends will have to defend the planet once again in this continuation of Akira Toriyama’s best-selling series, Dragon Ball!

Granolah is the last of the Cerealians, a people who were all but wiped out by the Saiyans and Freeza’s army many years ago. When he learns that the long-lost twin to the Dragon Ball that the old Namekian Monaito keeps in their home has been found, Granolah steals it and makes a wish that will allow him to start his quest for revenge against the Saiyans—to become the strongest being in the whole universe! Meanwhile, the Heeters work behind the scenes to put Granolah out of his misery once and for all…by enlisting Goku and Vegeta’s help!

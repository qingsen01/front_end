Willow of Ashes: Epic Fantasy (NecroSeam Chronicles Book 1)

"If Tim Burton had written Lord of the Rings" -̶̶̶ 1st PLACE WINNING FANTASY SERIES
The knights of Grim will pay any price to save a soul. But are their own souls worth that cost?
Born with split magic to raise the dead, honor-bound twin necromancers Xavier and Alexander are cursed by an ancient prophecy they can’t escape. To break their curse, they must venture to the five kingdoms and seek guidance from the world’s royals, which may reveal that there is more to the brothers’ halved magic than a mere arcane defect.

But with war breaking across the kingdoms, demons infesting the realms, and Death following them at every step, will the cure to the twin’s curse be worth the gruesome cost?

Ellie Raine has crafted an immersive world with magic like you’ve never seen before, and a hero and heroine for the ages – characters so sharply realized and so richly nuanced that this instant-classic will live on in hearts and minds for generations to come.
